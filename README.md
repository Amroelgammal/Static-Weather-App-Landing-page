This is a conversion from a professional PSD template &#x1F9F9; using Vanilla CSS/HTML
I haven't used any CSS fraweworks or HTML helpers. Just basic VSCODE stuff.

Surely I learned a lot about my personal coding style especially in CSS and how to manage separately organized style sheets which proved to be a quite helpful concept when handling challenging design elements in line with the "separation of concerns principle"	&#10004;

meeting designer's expectations and guidelines, pixel to pixel fidelity	&#x1F4CF;, as well as achieving maximum responsivity across different screen sizes and devices ðŸ“±, were key concepts that I improved while coding this projects

This is a conversion from a PSD template using Vanilla CSS/HTML

I haven't used any CSS fraweworks or HTML helpers. Just basic VSCODE stuff.
Surely I learned a lot about my personal coding style especially in CSS and how to manage separately organized style sheets which proved to be a quite helpful concept when handling challenging design elements in line with the "separation of concerns principle"

meeting designer's expectations and guidelines, pixel to pixel fidelity, as well as achieving maximum responsivity across different screen sizes and devices, were key concepts that I improved while coding this projects

This design is based on the contest winning PSD provided by [Bionocopy](https://gumroad.com/bionocopy) He was humble enough to share this online.

original .psd as well as a .png from it are provided in the src folder.
